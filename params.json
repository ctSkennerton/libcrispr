This includes information about the repeats, spacers and\r\ntheir arrangement.\r\n\r\nCurrently libcrispr implements an XML parsing interface for crispr files as well\r\nas an exception class for handling errors.\r\n\r\n##Prerequisites \r\nlibcrispr relies on Xerces-c++ for XML parsing.  It will need to be installed \r\non your system before use.\r\n\r\n##Installation\r\nOn most UXIX type systems the following commands should surfice:\r\n```\r\n./autogen.sh\r\n./configure\r\n[sudo] make install\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can also use the `--with-xerces=[ARG]` during configure to specify a non-standard \r\ninstal location for Xerces\r\n\r\n##Usage\r\nprograms using libcrispr should include the relevent header files with:\r\n ```\r\n#include <libcrispr/Xml.h>\r\netc...\r\n```\r\nand then add `-lcrispr` to the program's `LDFLAGS`\r\nYou may also need to set `LD_LIBRARY_FLAGS` if you install libcrispr in a non-standard location","google":"","tagline":"A small library for dealing with .crispr files"}
